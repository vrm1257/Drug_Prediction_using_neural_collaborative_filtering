# Drug_Prediction_using_neural_collaborative_filtering
Machine learning can be used in all aspects of human life

New Drug discovery can be very expensive and can take up to a year, Hence it is very beneficial to find the drug that can be used to treat the specific medical condition from the existing drugs. 

This idea is similar to the idea of recommendation systems where the item is recommended to the user based on certain factors  Similarly, we can recommend the drug for the treatment of certain medical conditions based on certain factors. 

To do so, here we are using the Nural collaborative filtering approach to predict the drugs for a specific medical condition. We will be using the Multilayer perceptron model as proposed in a
